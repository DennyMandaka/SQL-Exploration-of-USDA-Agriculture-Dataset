# SQL-Exploration-of-USDA-Agriculture-Dataset
This personal project is part of my SQL course assignment from UC Davis on Coursera. It involves exploring the USDA Agriculture Dataset to demonstrate fundamental SQL skills. The project showcases the use of basic SQL statements such as SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, and JOIN to analyze agricultural data efficiently.
