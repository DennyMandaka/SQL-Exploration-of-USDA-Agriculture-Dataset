# SQL-Exploration-of-USDA-Agriculture-Dataset
This project demonstrates SQL skills by analyzing datasets from the USDA’s open data portal. Queries focus on deriving insights about agricultural production, state-specific data, and cross-commodity comparisons to address real-world business questions.

## Dataset(s)
The datasets were sourced from the USDA’s open data portal and provided by UC Davis for the course’s final project. Here are the brief explanation of the datasets that were used: 
- Milk Production: Includes annual milk production values by state.
- Cheese Production: Monthly cheese production values by state.
- Coffee Production: Annual coffee production values.
- Honey Production: Annual honey production values.
- State Lookup: A reference table mapping state names to their ANSI codes.

## Questions/Problems
- What was the total milk production for 2023?
- Which states had cheese production greater than 100 million in April 2023?
- How has coffee production changed over the years, and what was its total value in 2011?
- What was the average honey production in 2022?
- What is the ANSI code for Florida?
- Can you list all states and their cheese production values, even if they didn’t produce cheese in April 2023?
- Which states are missing from the milk production dataset for 2023?
- Did Delaware produce any cheese in April 2023?

## Process
The queries can be found on the "SQL Queries and Questions".

## Insights and Conclusion
This project highlights the power of SQL in solving real-world business problems within the agricultural sector. The queries demonstrate skills in data aggregation, filtering, joining tables, handling missing data, and deriving actionable insights. These analyses not only provide specific answers but also reveal broader trends that can inform strategic decision-making in agriculture and related industries.
